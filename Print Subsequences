Print Subsequences
Send Feedback
Given a string (lets say of length n), print all the subsequences of the given string.
Subsequences contain all the strings of length varying from 0 to n. But the order of characters should remain same as in the input string.
Note :
The order of subsequences are not important. Print every subsequence in new line.
Input format
The input only consists of one line which consists of a single string
Output format
The output consists of all subsequences of the input string where each subsequence is printed in a different line. The order of the subsequences doesn't matter
Constraints
1 <= |S| <= 15
where |S| represents the length of the input string

Time limit: 1 sec
Sample Input:
abc
Sample Output:
"" (the double quotes just signifies an empty string, don't worry about the quotes)
c 
b 
bc 
a 
ac 
ab 
abc

    if d==2:
        return "abc"
    if d==3:
        return "ghi"
    if d==4:
        return "jkl"
    if d==6:
        return "mno"
    if d==7:
        return "pqrs"
    if d==8:
        return "tuv"
    if d==9:
        return "wxyz"
	return ""
def printKeypad(n,outputSoFar):
    if n==0:
        print(outputSoFar)
        return
    smallNumber=n//10
    lastDigit=n%10
    optionsForLastDigit=getString(lastDigit)
    for c in optionsForLastDigit:
        newOutput=c+outputSoFar
        printKeypad(smallNumber,newOutput)
